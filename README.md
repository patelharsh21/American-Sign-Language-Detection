# American-sign-language-detection

##Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a system that can detect American Sign Language
(ASL) gestures and display the corresponding text on a website. This project aims to bridge
the communication gap between the hearing-impaired or mute or the person who is
suffering from both and the rest of society by providing an easy-to-use interface for ASL
communication.
The problem addressed in this project is the lack of accessibility for the hearing-impaired
population in terms of communication with the rest of society. Many hearing-impaired
individuals use ASL as their primary mode of communication, but it is not widely
understood or used by the general population. This project aims to provide a solution to
this problem by creating a system that can easily translate ASL gestures into text for others
to understand
